**Mikansei 未完成** _(lit. unfinished)_ is a [Danbooru](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=rating:general) client for Android. Made with Jetpack Compose 🚀.

The name is inspired from my favorite [vocaloid](https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Vocaloid_Wiki) producer, [Orangestar](https://twitter.com/mikanseip)'s Japanese name version (蜜柑星, which is read _mikansei_).

This is a complete rewrite version of my old project [Mejiboard](https://github.com/uragiristereo/Mejiboard), that aims on delivering a great Danbooru browsing experience on Android.

#### What is Danbooru?

> Danbooru [dahn-boh-ruh] (noun):
> 1. (on donmai.us) A repository of high-quality anime-style art and doujinshi.
> 2. A taggable imageboard, with sophisticated features for keeping, organizing and finding pictures.
> 3. (Japanese) Corrugated cardboard box.

## Building

To build this project, you need the latest stable
of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

1. Clone the project and open in Android Studio.
2. Sync project with Gradle then Run 'app'.

Note: the `play` build variant will bundle Firebase Crashlytics to the app. By default it will use
the `oss` build variant. The `oss` build variant won't bundle Firebase at all. To use the `play`
build variant, you need to create 2 Firebase apps:

For production/release build, create a Firebase Android app with `com.uragiristereo.mikansei` as the
package name. And store the `google-services.json` file in this path:

```
~/app/src/play/release/
```

For dev/debug build, create a Firebase Android app with `com.uragiristereo.mikansei.dev` as the
package name. And store the `google-services.json` file in this path:

```
~/app/src/play/debug/
```
