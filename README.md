## Building

To build this project, you need the latest stable of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

1. Clone the project and open in Android Studio.
2. Sync project with Gradle then Run `app`.

**Notes:**

By default it will use the `ossDebug` build variant. The `playRelease` build variant will bundle Firebase Crashlytics to the app. The rest of the build variants won't bundle Firebase at all.

To use the `playRelease` build variant, first you need to create a Firebase Android app with `com.uragiristereo.mikansei` as the package name then store the `google-services.json` file in the root of `app` module.
